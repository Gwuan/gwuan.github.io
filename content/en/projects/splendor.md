## Disclaimer

This project was a group effort, and the codebase is hosted on HoGent's GitHub account, so I cannot share the source code. However, I enjoy discussing the project because it was a fun experience that involved multiple technologies.

The documentation for the public API is available  [here](https://jellerubbens.com/doc/splendor/index.html), Note that this documentation does **not** include source code. It only lists the functions used and their return values (only available in dutch).

## Overview

This project was a group exam assignment made during my first year in Applied Computer Science at Hogent. It is a clone of the boardgame [splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) written in Java.

We began by creating the user, state and flow diagrams inside [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/). After that, we set up the Ubuntu based server on the Azure dev platform and configured the database based on our needs. The UI was created with SceneBuilder, which integrated seamlessy with JavaFX.

## What I learned

Balancing server maintenance and security with software development was a fascinating challenge. It required considering various techniques to implement security measures and limit potential exploits (server and client based).

Our team also faced significant changes: we went from 5 members to 2 within a month. Despite this, we successfully delivered a fully functional game. Thanks to our detailed diagrams and documentation, we were able to pick up tasks from our former members with minimal friction. This experience reinforced for me the critical importance of thorough documentation and well-organized project resources.
