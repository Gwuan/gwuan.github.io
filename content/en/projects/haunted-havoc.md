## Overview

Haunted Havoc is a fast paced local multiplayer 1v1 or 2v2 party brawler developed in Unreal Engine 5 by our team at the Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE) programme in 2025. The project was completed over one semester (10 hours per week, excluding holidays).

Players take on the role of ghost wielding necromancers battling in a haunted graveyard arena. Collect ghosts, blast them at opponents, knock their spirit out of their body. Then either rescue your teammate or turn them into a explosive projectile.

## Highlights

- **Unique combat mechanics** – Shoot ghosts at opponents; if you hit them, their spirit leaves their body and becomes controllable.
- **Revive & steal systems** – Teammates can revive downed players by vacuuming their ghost and launching them back into their body. Opponents can also steal a ghost to use it as a explosive projectile or even revive the opponent accidantly .
- **Comeback upgrade system** – At the end of each round, the losing team receives a powerful upgrade to increase their chances in the next round. The chaos only grows!
- **Rapid iteration through sprints** – From early prototyping (ghost vacuum mechanic, player possession) to final polish, we documented sprint progress through devlogs.

## My Role

As one of the two programmers on the team, we were responsible for implementing all gameplay mechanics and core game systems. My main responsibilities included the upgrade system, team system, and revive system. I also worked closely with the sound and art departments to ensure gameplay felt impactful and responsive.  

This included exposing code to Blueprints at the appropriate level so that artists and designers could easily tweak gameplay values/behaviors without needing code changes.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5  
- **Programming**: C++ & Blueprints  
- **Platform**: Windows  
- **Collaboration**: Perforce & HacknPlan  
- **Art & Sound**: Substance Painter, Reaper, FMOD & Maya  

## What I Learned

- The collaboration with the different majors gave me valuable insight into how other departments think and work. It also improved the way I expose functionality through Blueprints, helping artists and designers work more efficiently.
- Gained a strong understanding of Unreal Engine 5 workflows and features, which significantly accelerated development.
- My planning and communication skills improved through regular coordination with other departments.
- Weekly builds forced us to reflect on progress, identify issues early, and regularly playtest. Which leads to valuable discussions and better iteration.
